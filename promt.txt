Assignment1 : Inverted Index Implementation and Comparative Analysis 
Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement an Inverted Index for a given text corpus and conduct a comparative analysis under different system configurations. You will study how linguistic preprocessing, positional information, and spell checking affect index size, query performance, and retrieval effectiveness. 

Task Description:
Consider the movies corpus shared on the drive/email
Preprocess the corpus (Every paragraph needs to stored as a document)

Baseline Index
    A)Tokenization only
    B)No preprocessing
    C)Non-positional inverted index


Construct the inverted index for the movies dataset and write the index to a text file.
Construct and compare the following variants:
with skip list implementation: 
show the results of queries that indicate reduction in latency 

With Linguistic Preprocessing:
Case folding
Stop-word removal
Stemming or lemmatization


Write the index to a text file. The size of the file reduces. Show the reduction in file size

With Positional Information
Positional index:
Term → list of (document ID, positions)
Show results for phrase queries


With Spell Check
Implement edit distance–based correction or k-gram based correction
Apply correction before query execution


Query Processing
Implement a simple query engine supporting:
    Single-term queries
    Multi-term Boolean queries (AND/OR)
    Phrase queries (for positional index)
Provide at least 10 test queries, including:
    Correctly spelled queries
    Misspelled queries
    Phrase queries
